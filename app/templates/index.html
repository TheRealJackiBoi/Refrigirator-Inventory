    <p class="flow-text">One common flaw we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support for truly responsive text. While elements on the page resize fluidly, text still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, for text heavy pages, we've created a class that fluidly scales text size and line-height to optimize readability for the user. Line length stays between 45-80 characters and line height scales to be larger on smaller screens.</p>
